### A bit more about me ...

I'm Rodgers M Gitau, a software developer based in Nairobi, Kenya. I specialize in building web applications that are performant, accessible and focused on the user experience.

In my professional journey, I started with a regular IT Administrator job at a leading hospitality group. After 5 years of doing this, it was time for me to rekindle my passion for coding and so I took a 6 months sabbatical to checkout [Moringa School's](https://moringaschool.com/) bootcamp. Needless to say, my sabbatical ended but I never went back.

I'm self-taught so my know-how is either by actual study or experiences that I've encountered in my career. At the start I worked mostly as freelance frontend developer but overtime, I grew frustrated with the increasing knowledge gap. I ended up joining the healthcare industry working for [Savannah](http://savannahinformatics.com/).

Most of my articles here are about the Javascript eco-system, WebGl and progressive web applications. Occassionally I explore game development and some backend stuff too. I'm also a *bonafide* nerd and content about music, anime, indie builds and fancy gadgets might find its way here too.

In the [play](/play/) section you will find a myriad of ideas ranging from absurd to genius that I explore in my attempts to unravel mysteries or discover new things.
