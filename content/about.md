### A bit more about me ...

I'm Rodgers M Gitau, a software engineer based in Nairobi, Kenya. I specialize in building web applications that are performant, accessible and focused on the user experience.

My professional journey started with a regular IT desk job with a leading hospitality group. During this period of about 5 years, I tried to get into coding but with so much work to do, I never actually begun. 

Eventually I took a sabbatical leave to join a bootcamp by [Moringa School](https://moringaschool.com). Needless to say, I never came back, formally quiting after the 6 months sabbatical ended.

At the start I worked mostly as freelance frontend engineer and had some memorable clients. Overtime, I grew frustrated with the increasing knowledge gap and also wanted something a little more permanent. I ended up joining [Savannah](http://savannahinformatics.com/), a company disrupting the healthcare industry.

Most of my articles here are about the Javascript eco-system, WebGl and progressive web applications. I'm also a *bonafide* nerd thus content about gaming, anime, indie builds and fancy gadgets might find its way here too.

In the [play](/play/) section you will find a myriad of ideas ranging from absurd to genius that I explore in my attempts to unravel mysteries or discover new things.
